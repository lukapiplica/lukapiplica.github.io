**Legal disclaimer**: I plan on using this PS4 to install Linux on it and play with it out of curiosity. I do not condone piracy; this article is meant only for educational purposes! I am not held accountable for your actions !

I bought a used PS4 Slim console to play with, and it was on **8.50** firmware and was never cleaned inside. The first thing I did was open it up to see what was "under the hood." When I opened it up, I saw dust and when I turned it on the PS4 was soo loud. That meant the thermal paste needed to be replaced, and the fans needed to be cleaned. Here is a picture of what was inside:

I planned on installing Linux on this PS4, but that requires a jailbreak and a specific firmware version, and that is why I bought it with a low enough firmware version so I can upgrade it to **9.00**. 

**You cannot downgrade firmware on the PS4; you can only upgrade it !**

What do you need:

>+ **Formated USB stick** 
>+ **Thermal Paste**
>+ **Screwdrivers**
>+ **Rubbing Alcohol**
>+ **Patience**
>+ **Computer/Laptop**


## Restoration:

Firstly I opened the PS4 up, unscrewed some screws, and this is what the insides looked like:

Now I use rubbing alcohol to get rid of the old thermal paste.

The new thermal paste I applied is Arctic MX-4.

After cleaning the fan and the heatsink, this is what the result looks like:

Much better !

## 9.00 Jailbreak

+ After I assembled the PS4 Slim, I booted it up **without Internet** and did a factory reset by going into the **Settings/Initialization/Initialize PS4**. This option erased everything on the PS4 that was previously on, including games and accounts.

+ Now comes the fun part, the jailbreak. Firstly go into **Settings/System/Automatic Downloads and make sure to uncheck all boxes**.

+ After that, go to **Settings/Network and uncheck the box that says Connect to the Internet**. This option prevents the PS4 from downloading the latest firmware update. 

+ Now go to **Settings/System/System Information** and see your firmware version. I have the 8.50 version, so I need to update my PS4 to 9.00 manually.

## Updating the PS4 to 9.00

+ To update the PS4 to 9.00, you will need a USB drive and a PC. First, you have to get the 9.00 firmware. There are two websites one has faster downloads but requires a free account, and the second one has slower downloads but requires no account. 

1. [Dark Software (faster downloads but requires an account)](https://darksoftware.xyz/PS4/FWlist)

2. [Darth Sternie (slower downloads but requires no account)](https://darthsternie.net/ps4-firmwares/)

+ Whichever you choose, make sure to download the 9.00 firmware. 

+ After the download, make sure to name the file **PS4UPDATE.PUP**

+ Now, format it in **exFAT** to your USB drive. 

+ After your USB has done formatting, go to the root folder of your USB and make a new folder called **PS4**, go into that folder and create another new folder called **UPDATE**, and then inside the UPDATE folder, you are going to copy the PS4UPDATE.PUP file. Keep in mind that the folders have to be in all caps. 

+ Now eject the USB drive, go over to the PS4 and **check your notifications** and clear them! 

+ Plug your USB drive into PS4 and go to **Settings/System Software Update**, which should detect the update from your USB to 9.00. Follow the instructions on the screen and update the PS4. 

## Jailbreaking the PS4 

+ After you are on the 9.00 firmware version, go to **Settings/Network** and check the box we unchecked earlier, **Connect to the Internet**. 

+ Now go to the option below **Set Up Internet Connection**, you can use either WiFi or Ethernet then choose **Custom**, you can choose if you want DHCP or a static IP, then choose **Do not specify** for DHCP hostname and make sure to choose **Manual** for the **DNS Settings**! 

+ As my **primary DNS**, I use **192.241.221.79**, and as my **secondary DNS**, I use **165.227.83.145**! These DNS IPs block all connections to Sony's servers so that the PS4 will not accidentally get an update. 

+ After the DNS has been specified, click next and choose **Automatic** for MTU Settings and **Do not use** for Proxy Server. 

+ Now unplug the USB drive from the PS4 that had the 9.00 update file and plug it back into the PC. 

+ On the PC, you will have to download [Rufus](https://rufus.ie/en/) and the [exfathax.img](https://github.com/ChendoChap/pOOBs4/blob/main/exfathax.img) from Github. Open Rufus, select your USB drive, and as the ISO, select the **exFAThax.img** file and click Start in Rufus.

+ Now go to the PS4 and before you plug in your USB, open the PS4 web browser and make sure to **clear all history and cache** from it. After that, you can use a host you like that offers payloads. 

+ I use [Karo218](http://www.karo218.ir)!

+ Now, after you have cleared all your browsing history, cookies and data, go to the host and click on **9.00 Gold** you will have to wait for the exploit to cache itself for offline use. After it is finished, click on the **GoldHenV2.2.4, and the exploit will tell you when to plug in your USB.**

+ Wait for the payload to display the GoldHEN notification, and you have a jailbroken PS4.

**NOTE**: If there are any errors or the console crashes, restart the PS4 and try again!  
**This Jailbreak is not persistent, which means after a shutdown or a reboot, you have to do everything again, one solutiion is to put your PS4 in rest mode, or you could make everything automatic, but it requires an ESP32-52 or a Raspberry Pi!**

## Conclusion

Enjoyable project to do, significantly since the price of the PS4 has dropped because of the PS5 release. Cleaning up the PS4 was satisfying, and I must say it is tricky to open the Slim model. Jailbreak was successful as expected, and for me, it worked almost 80% of the time, it had some crashes here and there, but a reboot fixed it. I am looking forward to installing Linux on the console. 

## Thank you for your time ðŸ’™
